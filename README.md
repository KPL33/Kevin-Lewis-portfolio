# Kevin-Lewis-portfolio

Here is my "Portfolio". As you'll see, I had A LOT of trouble understanding Flex-Box and positioning items in general. I watched about a dozen YouTube vids and read about as many articles on the subject. Office hours were of no help, and a tutoring session left me with more questions than answers (and the exmaple shown by the tutor actually did not react as expected, either).

I have attempted to satisfy all acceptance criteria to the best of my abilities at this point in the course.
